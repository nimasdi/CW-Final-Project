\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
First go Github website. Go to your repository, next using the new button create a new repository. Next you can name your repository and add a readme if you need to and then create the repository. Now you can clone the repository to your computer. Next we create the tex file and add the Github workflow file that was given.

\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
First we need to add .github/workflow file that was given in the example repository to our project. After that you need to also add tags in v*.*.* format to your commits then GitHub actions will automatically compile the latex file. The main point is to include the main.yml and its content to your repository.
